  - "The Fish called for a meeting. Slowly, the others arrived one by one. First came
    the Rabbit, hobbling without his old lamp. Next came the Bird, swooping down before
    resting neatly on a branch. Lastly, the Turtle crawled over laboriously, but greeted
    everyone with a small smile. They watched as you carefully place their offerings
    on the Sorcerer\u2019s grave."
  - "The Fish relayed the message to the others, asking to forgive the Sorcerer. Upon
    hearing the details of the discussion, the others murmured to each other. The
    Bird and the Turtle nodded to each other. After several more minutes of tense
    consideration, the Rabbit sighed in agreement and relaxed his shoulders. The Fish
    smiled and called out the Sorcerer\u2019s name."
  - "The restored grave shined with light for a moment. After the light faded, the
    Sorcerer appeared, his face wrought with doubt and anxiety. However, upon seeing
    everyone\u2019s smiles, he relaxed his body. "
  - "\u201CWelcome back, old friend,\u201D said the Fish."
  - "The Sorcerer\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears of relief and understanding. \u201CThank
    you everyone,\u201D his voice quivered. \u201CThank you.\u201D "
