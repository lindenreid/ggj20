  - "The Fish called for a meeting. Slowly, the others arrived one by one. First came
    the Rabbit, hobbling without his old lamp. Next came the Bird, swooping down before
    resting neatly on a branch. Lastly, the Turtle crawled over laboriously, but greeted
    everyone with a small smile. They watched as you carefully place their offerings
    on the Sorcerer\u2019s grave."
  - "The Fish relayed the message to the others, asking to forgive the Sorcerer. Upon
    hearing the details of the discussion, the others murmured to each other. A grim
    blanket clung onto the atmosphere. Even the Turtle\u2019s smile was nowhere to
    be seen."
  - 'Suddenly, wind flew in, wrapping itself around the grave. The offerings quivered
    in the air as they clung onto the weight of gravity. However, the wind was too
    strong and swept away the offerings.  '
  - 'A deep silence fell upon the forest. You look at the faces of the spirits. They
    do not return your gaze, but instead cast a faraway look at the tops of the trees.
    You realize that the Sorcerer is freed from his chains and passed on into the
    afterlife. But was this really for the best? Without a word, the spirits quietly
    leave the gravesite and disappear into the depths of the trees.  '
