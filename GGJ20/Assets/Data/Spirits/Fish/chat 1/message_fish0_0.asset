  - It is a brisk Saturday morning. You have just recently moved into a small village
    after hearing rumors of voices echoing from a forest at night. The atmosphere
    in the village is tense.
  - People have warned you to not go too deeply into the forest. You decide to help
    and investigate the forest.
  - After two hours of making your way deeper into the forest, you sit down by a creek
    to rest. Although the sun had already come up, the dense trees provided thorough
    coverage.
  - A thin layer of mist dampened the surrounding foliage.
  - 'As you rummage through your bag for a quick snack, you hear a voice from the
    left. '
