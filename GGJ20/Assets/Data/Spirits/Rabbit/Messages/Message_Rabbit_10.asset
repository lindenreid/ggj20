  - For centuries, we were the protectors of this forest. I have witnessed many people
    come and go over the years, from curious individuals to troublemakers.
  - Sometimes, the troublemakers would bring weapons to destroy the forest. They would
    try to plunder the area and steal what they could. It wasn't difficult to scare
    them off, though.
  - A glimpse of a shadowy silhouette... a mysterious snapping sound breaking apart
    the silence.... a lamp floating with its own volition.... it was easy!
  - No one ever got hurt. Although I can't say the same for their dreams at night.
