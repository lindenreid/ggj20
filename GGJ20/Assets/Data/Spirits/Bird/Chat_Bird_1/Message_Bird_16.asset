  - I felt very confused because Rabbit seemed so angry! Maybe Rabbit misses Sorcerer

  - "But I miss him a lot, too. I don\u2019t know what to do."
  - 'Rabbit says he did something very very very bad. But he was so nice to me. '
  - "I\u2019m sorry, maybe all this is confusing for you, too. I\u2019m better at
    eating seeds than thinking so deeply\u2026.  "
