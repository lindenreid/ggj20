  - "You want to know about my stick! Wow, it\u2019s been a while since anyone showed
    interest!"
  - Sorcerer went out walking one day, you see. He took lots of walks around the forest.
  - He always talked to everyone, asked them how they were doing. I was out on that
    same day, looking around for sticks and twigs and leaves and all sorts of treasures!
  - 'I really like to take care of my house. My house is very important to me! '
  - Sorcerer saw me and came over to ask what I was doing. I told Sorcerer that I
    was very very very busy getting sticks to make my house stronger.
  - Sorcerer told me that he would help me look for sticks!
  - 'So he got on his knees and started looking with me even though it made him tired.
    I was so happy! '
